    <h2>What</h2>
    <p>
      {project_title} is a free, open tool that can be used by anyone to explore key dimensions of the health innovation ecosystem, including research, startups and social activity. We aim to shed light on hidden innovations by bringing together previously siloed datasets, cutting edge data science techniques, and interactive visualisations into a platform that can be accessed by anyone, anywhere.
    </p>

      We are also grateful for the wide variety of people and organisations provided feedback and input along the way, particularly those who kindly volunteered their time to participate in user testing.

    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>
      The world is full of innovative people, projects, evidence, and organisations with vast potential to improve our collective health and wellbeing. Much of this potential remains untapped or underutilised, however, as these ideas and innovations never leave the place they were created. This project aims to take a first step toward bringing those innovations out of the shadows, allowing them to move across borders and contexts
