        "<p>I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? Obviously this blue part here is the land. See for more good stuff. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. Look what the homosexuals have done to me! You can't just comb that out and reset it? What a fun, sexy time for you.</p><p>But I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had to have the crotch taken in a little bit. She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto.</p><p>How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet.<p>Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. You boys know how to shovel coal?</p><p>Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Daddy horny, Michael. The only person that gets Lucille this excited is Gene. They frame my junk. A trick is something a whore does for money…or candy. … or cocaine. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. That's my son, you pothead!</p>",

Yes, he's like the steel man from The Wizard From Oz.</p><p>You mean the guy we're meeting with can't even grow his own hair? Come on! The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. Douche chill! Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! ps This one really cracks me up for some reason.</p><p>And here you are coming out of your mother's third base! No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break. But it wasn't. Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers!</p><p>I'M A MONSTER!! A night of heterosexual intercourse. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. Now, do you wanna steer, or are you too old to sit on your Pop's lap and drive? Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror.</p>",

        "<p>Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? I will be a bigger and hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh! I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn? And with deep, deep concentration and, and great focus, he's often able to achieve an erect– Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear. Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh.</p><p>I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! Sister's my new mother, Mother. And is it just me or is she looking hotter? Obviously this blue part here is the land. Smack of ham. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. I'll sacrifice anything for my children.</p><p>Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. Are you at all concerned about an uprising? She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB.</p>",

        "<p>I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! Who? i just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of ann. Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of funny.</p><p>Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other.</p><p>Happy Franklin Friday. I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? Speaking of settling, How's Ann? Are you sure this isn't her sister? Mrs Veal: What a lovely thing to say. Michael: That's an awful thing to say. I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her! Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth.</p><p>Tobias Fünke costume. Oh, like when they say \"poofter\" to mean \"tourist\", yes. You can always tell a Milford man. I'M A MONSTER!! It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time.</p>",
